**Review**

Time & space , these are two very important phenomrnon which kept humanity think for thousand of years  about this vast infinite universe and to find out its unapproachable interstellar destinations like solar system ,  milkyway , planets , blackholes ,etc. Highly talented great film maker Christopher  nolan has shown his  top class directorial skills by this great Sci fi saga " Interstellar"  . Probably its one of the best movie ever made its not only about finding new home for humanity in interstellar destination but its a emotional sci fi drama also a unbreakable relationship between father & daughter which has been portrayed in  memorable manner never before any director been able to do. Theme of movie  is about a space mission where a team of astronauts have been assigned a project to find out a new home for human race in vast infinite interstellar distances which also have been sewed with emotional father daughter relationship . This great sci fi will left you in deepest portion  of your mind where science & emotion collide with each other . From script to screenplay , cinematography  ,original score , editing , visual effects , performances , direction everything is 5/5. Just give heed to extraordinary directorial skills of Nolan the way he shot space travel  sequences which looks so real that you can feel them . Memorable performances by Mathew Mcconnaughy , Jessica chastin , Michael Caine , matt Damon . The moment when Cooper left the earth for space mission and then checks the logs of past years he found that his little daughter  is of his age now , that leave  everyone  in teary eyes , his promise to his daughter that when they will meet again she will be of his age she is  saying that's right time dad to come back . Just feel emotional intensity of this moment which is unparalleled a great piece of art in cinematic history . This movie leave us to a very likely question is there a future for humanity in interstellar infinite universe  , hopefully there is it will be our great human  efforts which will unravel the secrets of ambiguous universe . Astonishingly brilliant original score of Hans zimmer is another highlight of this great sci fi saga without which it couldn't have been a memorable masterpiece . Very few filmmaker have reached  to such perfection in sci fi zoner at which nolan reached through interstellar , I would recommend this great sci fi saga to everyone , just feel the secrets of mysterious time & space which have shaped our lives , it's a great lifetime experience
